description: Follow this rule when working on database
globs: 
---
-   Use **descriptive column names**.
-   Always use **foreign keys** with cascade delete to maintain integrity.
-   Use **Eloquent relationships** instead of manual joins.
-   Use `SoftDeletes` for models that require data recovery.
-   Keep migrations clean and avoid modifying existing ones in production.
-   Seeders and Factories should be used for testing and development.
-   Use **database transactions** for operations requiring rollback.
