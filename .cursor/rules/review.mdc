-   Follow **Git Flow** for version control (feature branches, PR reviews).
-   Use meaningful commit messages:

    ```
    git commit -m "[Feature] Implement user authentication"

    ```

-   Create **Pull Requests (PRs)** and get them reviewed before merging.
-   Follow **coding standards** and avoid unnecessary complexity.
-   Use **Laravel Pint** for auto-formatting PHP code.
