description: Follow this rules when working on debugging & logging
globs: 
---
-   Use **Laravel Telescope** (only in local environment).
-   Never enable `APP_DEBUG=true` in production.
-   Use **Monolog** for structured logging.
-   Log API requests for debugging:

    ```
    Log::info('API Request', ['user_id' => auth()->id(), 'request' => request()->all()]);

    ```

-   Store logs in separate files for easier debugging (`storage/logs/laravel.log`).
