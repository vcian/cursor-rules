### Folder Structure & Code Organization

-   `app/Repositories/Backend/` → Stores repository classes handling database interactions.
-   `app/Models/Backend/` → Stores models related to backend operations.
-   `app/Http/Controllers/Backend/` → Contains backend API controllers.

### Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) Principles

-   **Encapsulation:** Keep properties and methods private/protected where applicable.
-   **Abstraction:** Define interfaces for repositories and implement them.
-   **Inheritance:** Utilize Laravel's base classes where applicable.
-   **Polymorphism:** Use dependency injection and interface binding in repositories.
-   **Separation of Concerns:**
    -   **Controllers** should only handle HTTP requests and responses.
    -   **Repositories** should manage all data-related logic.
    -   **Models** should represent database entities.
